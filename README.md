## Churn_Prediction
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers switch from one service provider to another. By accurately identifying potential churners, telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce business loss.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a telecom dataset containing various features related to customer behavior, usage patterns, and service attributes. 
The dataset consists of the following columns:

•	'Customer ID': Unique identifier for each customer.

•	'Gender': Gender of the customer.

•	'Senior Citizen': Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not.

•	'Partner': Whether the customer has a partner or not.

•	'Dependents': Whether the customer has dependents or not.

•	'Tenure': Number of months the customer has stayed with the company.

•	'Phone Service': Whether the customer has a phone service or not.

•	'Multiple Lines': Whether the customer has multiple phone lines or not.

•	'Internet Service': Type of internet service subscribed by the customer.

•	'Online Security': Whether the customer has online security or not.

•	'Online Backup': Whether the customer has online backup or not.

•	'Device Protection': Whether the customer has device protection or not.

•	'Tec Support': Whether the customer has tech support or not.

•	'Streaming TV': Whether the customer has streaming TV or not.

•	'Streaming Movies': Whether the customer has streaming movies or not.

•	'Contract': The contract term of the customer (month-to-month, one year, two years).

# Results
The project aims to provide accurate predictions of customer churn in the telecom industry using logistic regression. 
By identifying potential churners, telecom companies can take proactive measures such as targeted marketing campaigns, personalized offers, or improved customer service to retain customers and mitigate churn. The performance of the logistic regression model can be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and compared to other machine learning algorithms to assess its effectiveness.
